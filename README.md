# Wallpaper-Clock
This is an Universal Windows Platform application that lets you select a list of pictures from your computer and assign to them a certain time or weather condition that you want that picture set as your wallpaper.
Here is a screenshot of the UI:

#### Building
To build this as a UWP application, open the solution in Visual Studio and export the project as a UWP app. You can also just run it in the visual studio emulator.




Note: Due to limitations in UWP, picture conditions are checked at 15-minute intervals.
